            <p class="text-justify">In response to those of our current members who wanted to help our civic association to grow by recruiting new members, we instituted our Walkabout Membership Recruitment Program whereby an existing member can donate a $15.00 membership (or multiple thereof) for a new person/family to join our civic association. In turn we select a target block in our community and civic association President – Thomas S. Baliga, along with Vice President - Michael Kovac, Board Member - Juanita Beltran and a current association member of the targeted block, then walk the block recruiting new members from those neighbors who have never been a member of the Archer Heights Civic Association.</p>
