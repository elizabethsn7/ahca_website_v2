So for the last six years, it‚Äôs played a big role in my life, and it‚Äôs been a core part of how I introduce myself to others.</p>
<p>Many ‚Äî if not most ‚Äî of my professional relationships have come from this community. So when I show up at a local event like WordCamp Toronto 2016, it feels like a reunion. For a good chunk of attendees, we‚Äôre beyond being contacts or colleagues or connections; we‚Äôre friends. And that adds a whole other dimension to the WordCamp experience.</p>

<p>As a Torontonian, I was happy to see WordCamp Toronto 2016 move into the downtown core. There‚Äôs a lot to love about our city, but out-of-town visitors haven‚Äôt experienced much of it during the last few WordCamps.</p>
<p>This time, attendees were steps from all of the major tourist attractions, and most everything else was a quick transit ride or cab ride away.</p>

<p>I was happy that the event moved into August. It‚Äôs the best possible weather you‚Äôll get in Toronto. A number of attendees even planned mini-vacations around #WCTO16 this year so they could squeeze in some recreation and relaxation time. (You don‚Äôt see much of that in the middle of November!)</p>
<p>And I was also happy to see so many new speakers coming to Toronto, some coming all the way from eastern Europe, or from the southwestern United States. (We often have folks coming up from the midwest, upstate New York, and New England, but they‚Äôre practically family at this point.)<br />
Overheard at WordCamp Toronto 2016<br />
So, with Toronto pride out of the way ‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs a bit of what we overheard this year.</p>

<p>We also can‚Äôt forget that WordPress is an incredibly user-friendly content management system that even the most novice shop owner can quickly wrap their head around.</p>
<p>So if you‚Äôre working with a brick-and-mortar business client, and want to help them uncover all that WordPress has to offer, I suggest keeping these four focus areas in mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_16336" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-for-brick-and-mortar-business.jpg"><img class="wp-image-16336 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-for-brick-and-mortar-business.jpg" alt="WordPress for Brick-and-Mortar Business" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-for-brick-and-mortar-business.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-for-brick-and-mortar-business-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ajabogado/3730930942/" target="_blank">Andrew Abogado</a> via <a href="https://visualhunt.com">Visualhunt.com</a> / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></p></div>
<h2>Embrace the SEO friendliness of WordPress.</h2>
<p>SEO is to websites as signage is to storefronts. Great signage attracts foot traffic. It tells potential customers what‚Äôs being offered inside. If the signage matches the passerby‚Äôs needs, they‚Äôll come in the door. The same is true for SEO. People tell search engines what they‚Äôre looking for, and if there‚Äôs a compelling result, they‚Äôll click through to the website.</p>
<blockquote><p>But SEO doesn‚Äôt just <em>happen</em>. SEO is built around content. Luckily content is exactly what WordPress is made for.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brick-and-mortar shops sell products and services, which can be described in detail on dedicated pages for each. So if a potential customer searches for ‚Äúred widgets near Hometown,‚Äù and a business in Hometown has a page dedicated to red widgets, they‚Äôre more likely to be matched up.</p>
<p>We also know that fresh content is an important <a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-fresh-factor-new" target="_blank">SEO factor</a>. Once again this is something WordPress does effortlessly, by making it easy to publish new content in the form of posts.</p>
<p>For a brick-and-mortar business, this ‚Äúfresh content‚Äù could be announcements about upcoming sales, reviews of new products, or helpful instructions for how customers can use products they‚Äôve bought in the store.</p>
<p>With those points in mind, it‚Äôs obvious that WordPress is the natural choice for SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set up your client‚Äôs site with <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/clients/nurture-leads-email-marketing/" target="_blank">email subscriptions</a>¬†and <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/launch/dos-and-donts-for-managing-comments-on-your-website/" target="_blank">commenting capabilities</a>¬†to boost visitor engagement. You can also take advantage of WordPress‚Äôs extensive selection of analytics plugins to help track success.</p>
<h2>Look for WordPress themes that complement the business.</h2>
<p>One of the many advantages to WordPress is that <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/selecting-a-wordpress-theme-10-critical-features/" target="_blank">themes make it easy</a> for your client to choose a starting point for how the site should look and feel.</p>
<p>You want people to feel welcomed in a store, so the space is designed with the shopper experience in mind. Decisions are made about furnishings and decor and the type of environment they create.</p>
<div class="callout"> The online presence should mirror the in-store experience as effectively as possible. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want visitors to find similar style, colors, tone and language both online and offline. On the website, try including photographs of the physical space, or staff members who customers are familiar with, to help bridge this gap even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-portfolio-themes.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16335" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-portfolio-themes.png" alt="wordpress portfolio themes" width="640" height="560" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-portfolio-themes.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-portfolio-themes-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Let your client browse <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank">free WordPress themes</a>¬†to learn their likes, dislikes and must-haves. You can help them narrow their focus using the feature filter in the theme directory. For shops that sell a lot of products, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/portfolio/" target="_blank">portfolio theme</a>¬†can work well for showcasing available goods. It mimics the experience of browsing aisles and shelves in person. For restaurants and cafes, <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/featured-image-header/" target="_blank">featured image headers</a>¬†are a handy feature for prominently displaying photos of interior spaces.</p>
<p>Remember that themes are anything but uniform. The flexibility and opportunities are endless, especially once you start customizing themes with page builders or custom CSS.</p>
<h2>Use WordPress plugins in a way that provides value to the business.</h2>
<p>In addition to themes, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">new plugins</a>¬†are constantly being added to the directory. Some of these plugins are purpose-built for the brick-and-mortar business, e.g. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/adding-enticing-restaurant-menus-wordpress-website/" target="_blank">restaurant menu plugins</a>, while others can be repurposed, e.g. using a paid membership plugin like <a href="https://memberful.com/" target="_blank">Memberful</a>¬†to set up a customer VIP program.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Why not use the website in-store, too? Use form plugins like <a href="https://ninjaforms.com/" target="_blank">Ninja Forms</a>¬†or <a href="https://formidablepro.com/" target="_blank">Formidable Forms</a>¬†to create surveys and gather information about customers while they‚Äôre physically present, then immediately reward them for completing the survey.</p>

<h2>Be diligent before diving into eCommerce.</h2>
<p>Content, themes and plugins are relatively easy for non-developers to work with. But the scale begins to tip when you get into eCommerce, especially if the client has complex or unique requirements.</p>
<blockquote><p>Understand up-front what aspects of your client‚Äôs brick-and-mortar business they want to mirror online. From taxes to payment gateways, eCommerce presents more hurdles for you as a website developer.</p></blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs not a cake walk for the client, either. They‚Äôll need to deal with the learning curve of managing the eCommerce backend. Handling inventory, fulfilling online orders, and providing accurate product details requires more work than just listing what‚Äôs for sale on a single page.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to set expectations early on. Everyone involved should know what‚Äôs involved. Avoid scope creep and surprises <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/clients/7-rules-of-client-relations-for-web-developers/" target="_blank">later down the road</a>¬†by addressing all questions early and often so you have the resources needed to finish the job on time and on budget.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve figured out what your clients need, there are a number of options to look into. <a href="https://wpecommerce.org/" target="_blank">WP eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://ithemes.com/exchange/" target="_blank">iThemes Exchange</a>, and of course <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/how-to-start-selling-on-wordpress-with-woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a>¬†are just a few of the many solutions available for selling products on a WordPress website.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Once you install these plugins and take care of the technical setup, you‚Äôll want to train your client so they can manage the day-to-day operations on their own, saving you both time and resources.</p>
<h2>WordPress is a perfect fit for bridging the gap between bricks and clicks.</h2>
<p>WordPress is SEO-friendly out of the box. Themes are a ready-to-go starting point for handling the site‚Äôs look and feel. Plugins extend functionality to suit the business‚Äôs needs. And with a bit of work, getting into eCommerce lets brick-and-mortar shops sell to customers that they never could‚Äôve reached otherwise.</p>
<p>With those four areas of focus in mind, your clients will be amazed at how powerful and stress-free a website can be with WordPress (and your expertise, of course!)</p>

<p>Boston University was a perfect venue in a perfect location. Perched on the shore of the Charles River, it offered a direct view of kayakers and boaters floating along in picturesque weather. (Not that we were envious or anything.)</p>
<p>Attendee check-in was effortless (props to <a href="https://twitter.com/jeckman" target="_blank">John Eckman</a>¬†and Co. for rocking the registration desk), and the common space ‚Äî wrapped by sponsors and filled with seating ‚Äî encouraged mingling and conversation.</p>
<p>We saw more of that mingling during lunch, with attendees grabbing bagged meals and taking a seat at shared tables. And we saw it again at the after party, where there was enough seating for people to gather and chat over food and drink.</p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Now, I don‚Äôt know if this was intentional or not. Maybe the layout and seating, and the conversations and sharing they facilitated, was entirely serendipitous. It‚Äôs hard to say. But I do know that I walked away from WordCamp Boston with one word stuck in my head:</p>
<p><em>Stories.</em></p>
<p>We all have them. And for many of us ‚Äî certainly those who are attending an event like #WCBOS ‚Äî WordPress plays a key role in how our stories get shared.</p>
<h2>WordCamps are great for sharing stories.</h2>
<p>You meet people face-to-face, ask them questions, answer theirs, and learn how they‚Äôre using WordPress. We met artists in need of an online portfolio, crafters and makers looking to sell products to faraway customers, and writers who just wanted to share their work. They were moonlighters, retired, hobbyists, professionals and fresh college graduates (not surprising, considering we were in Boston).</p>
<p>There are a lot of places to hear stories at a WordCamp. They‚Äôre often the basis of <a href="http://chrislema.com/delivering-great-technology-presentations/" target="_blank">great presentations</a>. But I‚Äôd argue that the single best place to hear stories is in the <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/12/making-the-most-of-the-conference-hallway-track/" target="_blank">hallway track</a>.</p>
<div class="callout"> Take the hallway track. It rocks. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve never heard of the hallway track you‚Äôre probably asking yourself, ‚Äúwhat the heck is a hallway track?‚Äù</p>
<p>The idea is simple: Instead of sitting in on sessions, you spend your time sitting in common spaces ‚Äî like hallways, hence the name ‚Äî chatting with other attendees. You can chat about whatever you want, WordPress or otherwise, and you‚Äôll likely walk away with stronger connections than if you just sat in sessions.</p>
<p>Some say that hallway tracks are the best part of a WordCamp. (Just don‚Äôt try to find it on the schedule.)</p>
<h2>Booths are boring.</h2>
<p>The sponsor experience typically involves sitting behind a swag-covered table. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. It‚Äôs just a bit boring. So we tried something different this time, choosing instead to create a space that encourages the aforementioned hallway track moments.</p>

<p>We had some very interesting conversations about <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/pokemon-go-lures-gamers-to-local-businesses-domains/" target="_blank">Pok√©mon Go</a>, accessible technology, augmented reality, exotic candies, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Get-Wound-Up-In-Cats-Cradle/" target="_blank">cat‚Äôs cradle</a>, the chaos of Boston traffic, and (of course) WordPress.</p>

<p>The pair have been running this setup since <a href="https://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Phoenix in 2014</a>, but it was my first time seeing it unfold in person. It was casual. It was fun.</p>

<blockquote><p>Showing up. That‚Äôs all you have to do. You don‚Äôt need to speak. You don‚Äôt need to volunteer. You don‚Äôt need to sponsor. You just need to be there.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that‚Äôs what WordCamps and WordPress meetups are for, right? Showing up.</p>
<p>And if you keep showing up, you may get comfortable enough to volunteer.</p>
<p>And once you start volunteering, you might feel comfortable to tell your story through a presentation.</p>
<p>And once you volunteer for a bit you might feel ready to organize a WordCamp, and help other people tell <em>their</em> stories.</p>
<p>You just gotta <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/how-to-contribute-to-the-wordpress-community/" target="_blank">show up first</a>.</p>
<h2>Where should you show up?</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre in the Boston area, check out the <a href="http://bostonwp.org/" target="_blank">local WordPress community</a>. They have a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/boston-wordpress-meetup/" target="_blank">meetup group</a>, a <a href="https://twitter.com/bostonwp" target="_blank">Twitter profile</a>, and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bostonwp/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>¬†to keep you in the loop.</p>

Selecting one to cater to online shopping ‚Äî an eCommerce WordPress theme ‚Äî can be just as much of a challenge, if not a greater one.</p>
<p>For example, if you go to WordPress.org and do a filter search with eCommerce, you will get 67 themes to choose from. If you Google eCommerce WordPress themes, the results go up exponentially ‚Äî to 2.7 <em>million</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding that ‚Äújust right‚Äù theme can‚Äôt be summed up in a few paragraphs, nor is there a silver bullet to finding it.</p></blockquote>
<p>eCommerce sites have too many variables to make it as easy as one-theme-fits-all. Here are six key questions to ask yourself as you start the quest of finding that perfect eCommerce WordPress theme for your online shop.</p>
<h2>1. Freemium or premium?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of well-built, free eCommerce themes out there. Before you try to cut your costs by snagging one of them, consider this: <em>You are building your store online. This is your business. Compare it to a brick-and-mortar store. If someone was advertising on Craigslist with an offer of an empty store that could be all yours for free, wouldn‚Äôt you wonder if some strings came attached with that?</em></p>
<p>There are many things to consider here, but, most importantly, you want to make sure that the free eCommerce WordPress theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the functionality you need.</li>
<li>is well-designed.</li>
<li>is well-built.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also want to know that it offers the <strong>support</strong> you need. What if the theme breaks? What if a critical plugin conflicts with it? In both scenarios, you could face the possibility of closing your virtual doors until it‚Äôs fixed. With most ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî premium themes, your support response is likely to be there when you need it, and in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to ask around, get ideas from trusted friends and colleagues, and read the reviews. You might even want to visit each theme‚Äôs support forum to see issues, solutions and response times that other users have experienced.</p>
<h2>2. Should you consider sliders?</h2>
<p>Sliders are one of the most common elements seen when online shopping. At first glance as an online shop owner, you might be impressed with the large visual highlighting a few of your featured products.</p>
<div class="callout"> In reality, sliders don‚Äôt always work the <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/design/wordpress-sliders-awesome-design-elements-or-instruments-of-the-devil/" target="_blank">way you hope</a>, especially for your users. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some time back, a video I watched shared some good food for thought on sliders: A brick-and-mortar store rigged one of the walls in their shop so that as people started viewing the clothes, the wall moved away and a second wall slid into place ‚Äî stocked with all new items. Shoppers frustratingly watched as the shirt they were interested in slipped out of their hands only to be replaced by new choices. The point of this analogy was that the abandonment rate is already high for online shoppers, without pulling away something they actually might have wanted to purchase.</p>
<h2>3. How does the home page present your store?</h2>
<p>The layout of the home page is going to be very critical here. Even though many people will land on specific product pages ‚Äî either through searches or external links ‚Äî a good number of people will still end up on your home page as first-time visitors.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is be very clear about is what you are selling. Secondly, you need to decide how many products you will show and which will be the ones you want people to see first. Does the layout give single product options? Or is it able to visually present categories of products?</p>
<p>The home page can be the most confusing part of any eCommerce WordPress theme because you don‚Äôt always know exactly what you can do by just looking at the demo. Some layouts are constructed in stone. Other themes may give you a home page consisting of widgets, which give you a little more flexibility. Still others are more like page builders, letting you create your own custom home page without knowing code. The options are endless, but just know that they are out there.</p>
<h2>4. Can shoppers find what they want easily?</h2>
<p>When considering an eCommerce WordPress theme, look at the options for easy navigation.</p>
<p>Of course, you will want a powerful search beyond the WordPress default search ‚Äî and that can typically be done with a plugin. But navigation placement is critical to helping your customers find exactly what they want, when they want it.</p>
<div class="callout"> If you have a larger online store, you might want to take advantage of a <a href="https://www.sourcewp.com/wordpress-mega-menu-plugins/" target="_blank">mega menu</a>. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some developers are critical of them, but if well designed, they can help your customers move around your site much easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://wpmegamenu.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16218" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ecommerce-wordpress-theme-ubermenu.png" alt="eCommerce WordPress Theme UberMenu" width="640" height="405" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ecommerce-wordpress-theme-ubermenu.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ecommerce-wordpress-theme-ubermenu-768x486.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2>5. Do your theme and eCommerce plugin play well together?</h2>
<p>Typically your theme is not built with eCommerce in it, but rather framed to work well with popular eCommerce plugins like <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/how-to-start-selling-on-wordpress-with-woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a>.</p>
<p>Although a lot of themes work very well with WooCommerce, not every theme works out of the box. You may get a message that says this particular theme does not declare WooCommerce support. In most cases, it‚Äôs just a matter of adding a little code. But the compatibility challenges can range from minor issues to your site not working at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may use a plugin similar to <a href="https://cart66.com/" target="_blank">Cart66</a>. What this does is handle all of the cart functionality, creating your carts on their server. You are just using a shortcode to place your cart in a standard WordPress post or page, so it doesn‚Äôt matter which theme you use.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart66-cloud/screenshots/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16217" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ecommerce-wordpress-theme-cart66.png" alt="eCommerce WordPress Theme Cart66" width="600" height="302" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ecommerce-wordpress-theme-cart66.png 600w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ecommerce-wordpress-theme-cart66-768x386.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>These are only a couple of examples of plugins and themes, so you will want to choose carefully and do your research.</p>
<h2>6. Is your theme mobile-friendly?</h2>
<p>We all know that your site needs to be <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/need-know-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-wordpress/" target="_blank">mobile-friendly</a>¬†these days. But with an online store, it is even more critical.</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of people shopping on their smartphones <a href="http://digiday.com/brands/mobile-commerce-going-2016/" target="_blank">has exploded</a>¬†and will only continue to grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something thing I hear a lot with users on eCommerce sites: the challenges of buying online with their smartphones.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to make sure your theme is <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/design/mobile-theme-roundup-testing-tools-mobile-friendly-wordpress-themes/" target="_blank">mobile responsive</a>¬†‚Äîand that it works well with your eCommerce plugin. Some people will choose to go the app route, but unless you are a big-box store, it‚Äôs likely that most people won‚Äôt add yet another app to their phone just to buy stuff from your site. The good news? There are now plugins coming out for some of the more popular eCommerce plugins, which are designed to make your online store more mobile-friendly.</p>
<h2>The right eCommerce WordPress theme for you</h2>
<p>We have just touched the tip of the iceberg here with these tips to help you get started in choosing that right theme for your WordPress online store. It‚Äôs a good idea to take your time to do the research and get help from friends and colleagues ‚Äî people you know and trust.</p>
<p>The least effective way is to go into a Facebook group and publicly ask if people could suggest an eCommerce WordPress theme. You will end up getting so many conflicting answers that you will likely just be even more confused. Reach out to the right people and you will get what you need.</p>

Despite the obvious importance of this fact, a shocking amount of businesses that depend on real-world visits for their survival fail to make finding their location easy for their audiences with website maps.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre fixing up your own site, or adding maps and directions to a site for a client, it‚Äôs a task that should be very high up on your site launch checklist. Furthermore, you‚Äôll want to take care of implementation in as quick and convenient a manner as possible.</p>
<p>In this piece, we‚Äôll step through the main ways of adding maps to a WordPress site, and tick off some common sense maps basics you should consider along the way.</p>
<h2>Start <em>outside</em> your site</h2>
<p>Hopefully, the utility of having simple and obvious online directions to your business is relatively clear, so we‚Äôre not going to massively belabor the point. However, if you or your client are in any doubt about it, a quick look at the image below should be enough to drive the point home:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/website-maps-google-serp.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15983" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/website-maps-google-serp.png" alt="website maps google SERP" width="640" height="579" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/website-maps-google-serp.png 628w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/website-maps-google-serp-768x694.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Google itself has decided that the two most important aspects of your business, from a user‚Äôs point of view, are its website and clear directions for how to get there.</p>
<p>Speaking of Google, before you even think of adding website maps, make absolutely sure you‚Äôve signed up for <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank">Google My Business</a>. This gives people the best possible chance of finding your business, without even having to visit your site. And be sure to check out <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/products/business-marketing.aspx?isc=cardigan" target="_blank">GoDaddy‚Äôs Get Found</a>¬†solution to easily manage your business‚Äôs local online listings from one handy dashboard.</p>
<p>OK, with that point out of the way, let‚Äôs move on to actually adding maps to a site. You‚Äôve got two basic choices here.</p>
<h2>1. Quickly embed a map by hand</h2>
<p>Sometimes you just want to quickly add a map to a page or post, then move on with your day. The <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/144361" target="_blank">simplest way of doing</a> so is to begin by firing up Google Maps and setting the screen to your liking.</p>
<h4>1. Click the hamburger menu icon on the top left of the screen.</h4>
<div id="attachment_15979" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-by-hand.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-15979" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-by-hand.png" alt="google maps embed by hand" width="640" height="354" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-by-hand.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-by-hand-305x170.png 305w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-by-hand-768x424.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you choose to include directions from the outset, they‚Äôll be included in your eventual embed.</p></div>

<h4>2. Select¬†<strong>Share or embed map.</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-share-or-embed-map.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15982" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-share-or-embed-map.png" alt="google maps share or embed map" width="640" height="341" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-share-or-embed-map.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-share-or-embed-map-768x409.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h4>3. Select¬†<strong>Embed map¬†</strong>in the resulting pop-up.</h4>
<p>You‚Äôll be given a handy iframe snippet, which can be placed wherever you like across posts or pages in WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-map.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15980" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-map.png" alt="google maps embed map" width="640" height="453" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-map.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-embed-map-768x543.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>You‚Äôll notice that parameters such as width and height are exposed in the embed code if you want to tweak them further:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-parameter.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15981" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-parameter.png" alt="google maps parameters" width="640" height="379" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-parameter.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/google-maps-parameter-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth pointing out that there‚Äôs also an official <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/" target="_blank">Google Maps Embed API</a>¬†if you‚Äôre looking for more fine-grained programmatic control. However, bear in mind that <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/" target="_blank">usage restrictions and pricing</a>¬†might apply if you go down this route.</p>
<h2>2. Use a plugin to handle maps integration</h2>
<p>This being WordPress, you‚Äôve also got the option to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/hot-100-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/" target="_blank">use a plugin</a>¬†to handle the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>There are numerous <a href="https://designscrazed.org/wordpress-google-map-plugins/" target="_blank">map plugins</a>¬†floating around out there, but the two strongest contenders are <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">MapPress Easy Google Maps</a>¬†and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-maps/" target="_blank">WP Google Maps</a>. Both of these have wide install bases, excellent overall ratings, and are available in free and premium versions.</p>
<div id="attachment_15984" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wp-google-maps-plugin.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-15984" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wp-google-maps-plugin.png" alt="wp google maps plugin" width="640" height="205" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wp-google-maps-plugin.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wp-google-maps-plugin-768x246.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WP Google Maps is a leading contender when it comes to WordPress map plugins.</p></div>
<p>WP Google Maps is the frontrunner out of the two, and offers an impressive range of functionality in the free version that should have you covered for most standard use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-maps/installation/" target="_blank">Installation and basic use</a>¬†are both a snap, and it takes a matter of seconds to put together a quick map with full control over elements such as width, height and markers. It also enables you to easily integrate <a href="https://www.google.com/intx/en/work/mapsearth/retail/" target="_blank">Google Store Locator</a>. If you find yourself needing a bit more power, <a href="http://www.wpgmaps.com/purchase-professional-version/" target="_blank">the pro version of the plugin</a>¬†has a very reasonable paid license option.</p>
<h2>Make your website maps easy to find</h2>
<p>Before we finish up, it‚Äôs worth emphasizing that you should go out of your way to draw attention to your location map once you have it on your site. Again, this an area where a surprising amount of sites fall down.</p>
<p>Make sure there are prominent links to the map throughout your site, and that you‚Äôre including any useful additional information such as parking arrangements, opening hours, and so forth on the actual page itself. Also, be absolutely sure that you‚Äôve checked <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/need-know-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-wordpress/" target="_blank">how your maps page looks on mobile</a>, or you risk antagonizing customers before they even reach your store!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Integrating a map into your site is one of those classic areas that‚Äôs basically straightforward, but where an awful lot of sites drop the ball. However, with the information we‚Äôve outlined, you should be in a great position to get it right!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs step through the main points one more time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the site you‚Äôre working on is fully signed up to Google My Business to help users find your business.</li>
<li>If you‚Äôre in a hurry, quickly embed a map into WordPress via iframe directly from Google Maps.</li>
<li>Use a plugin such as MapPress Easy Google Maps or WP Google Maps if you‚Äôre looking for fine-grained control.</li>
<li>Review your site from a user perspective, and make sure it‚Äôs incredibly easy to find your location details.</li>

One of the main areas where many restaurant sites drop the ball is in their presentation of restaurant menus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Outside of presenting crystal clear details of location and opening hours, making a menu that‚Äôs easy to find and read may be the most crucial job a restaurant website has. Despite this seemingly obvious requirement, it‚Äôs astonishing how many sites still make reading restaurant menus a chore for users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, WordPress has a number of easy-to-implement solutions available to help tackle this task. In this piece, we‚Äôll highlight four options ‚Äì two themes and two plugins ‚Äì but before we get down to business, let‚Äôs briefly remind ourselves why it‚Äôs so important to get restaurant menus right.</p>
<h2>Why your restaurant site needs an enticing menu</h2>
<p>There‚Äôs a reason virtually every restaurant on earth makes its menu easily readable outside their establishment. People want to know what they serve ‚Äì and how much it‚Äôs going to cost ‚Äì before they go through the door.</p>
<p>This is as true online as it is offline ‚Äì a 2015 study by the <a href="http://www.restaurant.org/" target="_blank">National Restaurant Association</a>¬†showed that 70 percent of <a href="http://www.singleplatform.com/blog/2015/02/11/15-key-stats-nras-restaurant-industry-forecast/" target="_blank">smartphone users</a>¬†view restaurant menus on their phones at least a few times per year. Against that type of background, going for solutions not optimized for all browsing situations (such as offering PDF menus) simply isn‚Äôt going to cut the mustard.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre tackling a restaurant website project today, you basically have two choices in terms of implementing a slick menu solution in WordPress: go with a dedicated restaurant theme, or integrate a standalone restaurant menu plugin.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at some choices for both options.</p>
<h2>WordPress restaurant themes with solid menu options</h2>
<p>A number of solid themes aimed directly at the restaurant market have emerged over the last few years. Pick the right one to base your project on, and you can kill several birds with one stone: optimal display on smart devices, slick visual presentation, booking integration options, and an intuitive way of easily displaying menus should all come as standard.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll find <a href="http://www.codeinwp.com/blog/restaurant-wordpress-themes/" target="_blank">restaurant theme roundups</a>¬†aplenty online, but the following two selections stand out from the crowd, and more than deliver on the menu front.</p>
<h4>Canap√© from Automattic</h4>
<p>Using an <a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>¬†theme is generally a guarantee of high standards and carefully considered details throughout. As <a href="https://wptavern.com/canape-an-elegant-free-restaurant-theme-for-wordpress" target="_blank">WP Tavern‚Äôs review</a>¬†makes clear, the recently launched <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/canape/" target="_blank">Canap√©</a>¬†is no exception to this rule.</p>
<div id="attachment_15799" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Canape-Theme-Restaurant-Menus.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-15799" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Canape-Theme-Restaurant-Menus.png" alt="Canape Theme Restaurant Menus" width="640" height="372" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Canape-Theme-Restaurant-Menus.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Canape-Theme-Restaurant-Menus-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Canap√©‚Äôs default restaurant menu style ticks all the right boxes and looks great on mobile.</p></div>
<p>The theme‚Äôs simple but <a href="https://canapedemo.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">classic styling</a>¬†looks superb on smaller devices, integrates smoothly with <a href="https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/open-table-widget/" target="_blank">OpenTable</a>, and enables you to showcase testimonials and featured menu items on your home page with ease.</p>
<p>Creating stylish menus with <a href="https://canapedemo.wordpress.com/menu/" target="_blank">multiple sections</a>¬†is a piece of cake, and you can easily rearrange their order on the WordPress backend. The one downside is that images aren‚Äôt easily integrated with menu items by default.</p>
<h4>Auberge from WebMan Design</h4>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a bit more control over menu options in particular, the free <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/auberge/" target="_blank">Auberge restaurant theme</a>¬†for WordPress has a lot to offer. Auberge <a href="https://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/auberge/" target="_blank">looks great</a>¬†on all devices, has solid <a href="https://www.webmandesign.eu/manual/auberge/#" target="_blank">online documentation</a>, and enables you to build stylish <a href="https://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/auberge/menu/" target="_blank">multilevel menus</a>¬†with ease.</p>
<div id="attachment_15798" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Auberge-Theme-Restaurant-Menus.png"><img class="wp-image-15798 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Auberge-Theme-Restaurant-Menus.png" alt="Auberge Theme Restaurant Menus" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Auberge-Theme-Restaurant-Menus.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Auberge-Theme-Restaurant-Menus-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Auberge enables you to stylishly showcase individual dishes.</p></div>
<p>Auberge also plays nicely with the popular <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/" target="_blank">Beaver Builder</a>¬†page builder plugin, and can be used to create slick recipe sections via the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/webman-amplifier/" target="_blank">WebMan Amplifier plugin</a>.</p>
<h2>Standalone plugin solutions for restaurant menus</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you‚Äôre looking to integrate menus with an existing theme, there are a number of <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/bon-apetit-six-of-the-best-wordpress-restaurant-menu-plugins" target="_blank">dedicated plugins</a>¬†you can use to get the job done quickly and easily. The following two stand out for their range of features and ease of use.</p>
<h4>Food and Drink Menu plugin</h4>
<div id="attachment_15801" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WordPress-Food-and-Drink-Menu-Plugin.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-15801" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WordPress-Food-and-Drink-Menu-Plugin.png" alt="WordPress Food and Drink Menu Plugin" width="640" height="202" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WordPress-Food-and-Drink-Menu-Plugin.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WordPress-Food-and-Drink-Menu-Plugin-768x242.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Food and Drink Menu plugin is highly rated, free, and gets the job done with no fuss.</p></div>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/" target="_blank">Food and Drink Menu</a>¬†plugin is designed to do exactly what its name suggests, enabling you to slot solid menu functionality into the restaurant site of your choosing. With rock solid ratings, <a href="https://themeofthecrop.com/2014/07/31/achieve-complex-menu-layouts-food-drink-menu" target="_blank">handy tutorials</a>, and a <a href="http://doc.themeofthecrop.com/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/user/" target="_blank">straightforward user guide</a>¬†to show you the way, this is a plugin you can start using with confidence on client sites in no time at all.</p>
<h4>FoodPress plugin</h4>
<div id="attachment_15800" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FoodPress-WordPress-Plugin.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-15800" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FoodPress-WordPress-Plugin.png" alt="FoodPress WordPress Plugin" width="640" height="179" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FoodPress-WordPress-Plugin.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/FoodPress-WordPress-Plugin-768x214.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">FoodPress covers you completely for menu options, and much more besides.</p></div>
<p>If you‚Äôre prepared to invest a little upfront cash to get the job done, <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/foodpress-restaurant-menu-reservation-plugin/6480595" target="_blank">FoodPress</a>¬†will have you covered for a very reasonable fee. In addition to built-in reservation and notification options, it comes with a genuinely impressive range of <a href="http://demo.myfoodpress.com/" target="_blank">menu formats</a>¬†to showcase your wares. The plugin also provides additional menu functionality in the form of location-specific menus, menu categorization options, and support for custom menu icons.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Savvy restaurant owners know that online menu presentation simply has to be on point, otherwise people will be taking their business elsewhere. Fortunately, there‚Äôs a range of easy-to-integrate WordPress solutions just sitting there waiting to be used.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs recap the two basic options you have, along with our specific recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go with a dedicated restaurant theme.</strong> <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/canape/" target="_blank">Canap√©</a>¬†is a great choice if you‚Äôre looking for a simple yet elegant menu solution. However, <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/auberge/" target="_blank">Auberge</a>¬†gives you a bit more power to play with across the board.</li>
<li><strong>Use a standalone menu plugin.</strong> The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/" target="_blank">Food and Drink Menu</a>¬†plugin will get the job done quickly. If you want wider design and additional options, consider <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/foodpress-restaurant-menu-reservation-plugin/6480595" target="_blank">investing in FoodPress</a>.</li>

<p>Not to worry, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/lonely-blogger-find-friends-blogosphere/" target="_blank">my bloggy friends</a>! I will explain some of the problems causing your low readership and offer solutions to get your awesomeness exposed, STAT!</p>
<h2>Problem: Nobody knows you exist.</h2>
<p>The sad reality is that building a blog doesn&#8217;t mean you will magically get readers. Think about it ‚Äî how can anyone read your brilliant prose if they don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s out there? When was the last time you stumbled upon a fantastic movie or television show? More often, it comes up in conversation. You hear someone talk about it with excitement, then you go watch it and fall in love with it. Unless you hear about it, you never know to look for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blog-traffic-alone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15762" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blog-traffic-alone.jpg" alt="Blog Traffic Alone" width="640" height="461" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blog-traffic-alone.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/blog-traffic-alone-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2>Solution: Promote the heck out of your blog.</h2>
<p>And therein lies your solution. Shout from the rooftops that you have web real estate! Promote your blog on your <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/using-social-media-to-make-your-blog-more-profitable/" target="_blank">social media channels</a>, tell ALL your friends, and maybe do some <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/earn-street-cred-by-guest-posting/" target="_blank">guest blogging</a>. Then, once you have gotten the word out to everyone you can, ask others to tell everyone they know.</p>
<div class="callout"> There is no harm in asking for the share. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the worst that can happen? Yes, someone can say no, or simply not respond. But if you never ask for the share, the answer will always be no.</p>
<h2>Problem: No one quite gets what your blog is about.</h2>
<p>People like it when you keep it simple. They want to know exactly what they are getting themselves into when they come to your page. If your blog lacks a roadmap, it‚Äôs not only challenging to navigate ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to figure out what to come back for the next time.</p>
<h2>Solution: Find your niche.</h2>
<p>So, niche it down, baby. Remember, the goal is to attract readers who are interested in something and keep them coming back. Your niche can be a little broad, but don&#8217;t make it <em>too</em> broad. Also, don&#8217;t draw in readers with your niche and jump to a new one without warning.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say your blog is about horror movies. If you start writing about every type of film except for horror movies, why would a horror-movie buff keep coming back? They will pull a Mike Myers and cut you from their life, man! No one wants to watch their readership die. The horror! The horror!</p>

<h2>Problem: You don&#8217;t post often enough.</h2>
<p>Once you do start getting some readers, you have to keep posting quality content to give them an incentive to return. For example, you tell your readers to ‚Äústay tuned for next week‚Äôs discussion of all the ways to prevent foot fungus,‚Äù but you don‚Äôt deliver. How will your readers ever know how to keep the grossness off their toes? They will dump you and move on to another blog that <em>does</em> answer the question. You‚Äôve lost your true love forever.</p>
<h2>Solution: Publish consistently.</h2>
<p>Just as no one likes to get all excited with the first date only to never have a second, don‚Äôt tell your readers to return for a piece on green toenails and refrain from giving them the goods. People like consistency. They want to know that if you tell them new posts will be available every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, new posts are indeed available every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>
<h2>Problem: You post too often.</h2>
<p>As your readership grows, you might need to increase the number of days you post each week. But don&#8217;t go overboard. Let‚Äôs say you have a couponing website with time-sensitive posts. Your readers will expect that you constantly post new information because they know that new coupons come out daily, sometimes hourly. However, there is no reason to post every 20 minutes about hair dye. Not only will you run out of subjects to write about, your audience may feel overwhelmed by too much information.</p>
<h2>Solution: Find the right publishing cadence.</h2>
<p>Keep your readers coming back ‚Äî with genuine interest ‚Äî by spreading out your goodies across several posts. Just because you know everything there is to know about your subject doesn&#8217;t mean you have to post it all at once. Draw it out into sizable chunks, enticing your reading to return again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Plan a series of related posts. Tease each upcoming article in the preceding post to get readers excited about what‚Äôs in store.</p>
<h2>Problem: Your website is overloaded with ads and pop-ups.</h2>
<p>When I visit a site that is cluttered with ads, I flee. And If I really get into the first paragraph of a post only to be greeted suddenly with a pesky pop-up that will not close, I leave. Oh, how I loathe those websites that make me watch a 30-second ad before getting to what I want to read. Ahem! I&#8217;m talking to you news websites!</p>
<h2>Solution: Find a friendly balance between content and ads.</h2>
<p>Yes, I prefer a site with no fluff, just the news. But I get it ‚Äî you need to monetize. And that‚Äôs fine. Just don‚Äôt lose site of your actual content in all the <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/blog-spammy/" target="_blank">advertisements and spam</a>. Find a balance that will work for both you and your readers. Besides, there are plenty of other (more meaningful) ways to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/5-meaningful-ways-to-make-money-blogging/" target="_blank">make money blogging</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem: Your site takes forever to load.</h2>
<p>You know the type ‚Äî buffering, more buffering, oh, wait! It‚Äôs finally loading! Nope. Still buffering. And now I am bored. I am done with your site. That‚Äôs how quickly a potential reader can abandon your site. Forever.</p>
<h2>Solution: Monitor load times and fix the culprits.</h2>
<p>If this is an issue with your site, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/development/are-slow-website-load-times-costing-you-money-and-pageviews/" target="_blank">read this post</a>. It will walk you through the issues you might need to address, including external APIs, too-large image files and crappy web hosting.</p>
<h2>Get more blog traffic</h2>
<p>I hope this post has provided you with some ideas as to what might be preventing more readers from visiting your site and how you can avoid blog traffic jams. To recap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid a ‚Äúpost it and forget it‚Äù approach to blogging. Promote the heck out of every blog post. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/often-promote-blog-posts/" target="_blank">Here are some tips</a> to help with that.</li>
<li>Stick to topics related to the niche you‚Äôve chosen.</li>
<li>Establish a consistent, reasonable publishing schedule.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of advertising content on your site; instead, look for other ways to make money blogging.</li>
<li>Keep close tabs on page load times. Be sure to compress images and host with a reputable company (<a href="https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting?isc=cardigan" target="_blank">ahem, GoDaddy</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Until next time, fellow bloggers &#8230; May your pageviews and income from blogging reach new heights!</p>

Questions run through your mind: Will people like it? Will they even read it? How the heck will they find it? How will you promote it?</p>
<div class="callout"> One of the keys to success is a seamless, reader-focused blog launch plan. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the things you need to know.</p>
<h2>Build an email list to promote your blog <em>before</em> it launches</h2>
<div id="attachment_15650" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/promote-your-blog.jpg"><img class="wp-image-15650 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/promote-your-blog.jpg" alt="promote your blog" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/promote-your-blog.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/promote-your-blog-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/38902313@N04/5621962834/" target="_blank">g_firkser</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>
<h4>If you have an existing site&#8230;</h4>
<p>Find a prominent spot on your site to start talking about your upcoming blog. Go beyond an announcement that just says, ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù Get people so excited about your topics and plans that they will want to subscribe before you even publish your first post.</p>
<p>There are several options for <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/beginners-guide-to-starting-an-email-list/" target="_blank">starting your email list</a>, from signups in the sidebar to pop-ups, and everything in between. While pop-ups have their pros and cons, be careful about making the decision based on your own personal feelings. Because even if they are annoying to you, the truth is, they work. So do your research and consider finding a few to test on your site.</p>
<h4>If you don‚Äôt have an existing site&#8230;</h4>
<p>Create a landing page and find ways to drive people to it. In its simplest form, your landing page will be just a single page that you send people to for a brief announcement, with a sign-up to be notified when you launch your blog.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/9-lead-magnet-ideas-and-incentives-to-grow-your-email-list-in-2016" target="_blank">offering an incentive</a>. If you are a B2B business, consider offering a white paper or a useful guide. Don‚Äôt be worried about the people who will sign up only to get the gift and then unsubscribe the first chance they have, because there are always a few of those. But for the most part, these are your customers who already know and like your stuff. Enough of them will give you a chance.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre using WordPress, several plugins allow you to create a landing page or a ‚Äò‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù page. But be sure to offer a teaser or a small taste of your content and a signup form because ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù is not enough of an enticement.</p>
<h2>Take advantage of social media</h2>
<p>You might have a Facebook page that has served as your business‚Äôs online presence. Now that you are ready to launch that blog, don‚Äôt hesitate to share it with the world. Facebook is another good place to give readers teasers that will show them what they can expect on your new blog. From there, send them directly to the landing page so they can subscribe.</p>
<p>Consider using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-basics" target="_blank">Facebook ads or promotions</a>¬†to get the word out and increase your pre-launch subscription numbers. You can even create a separate tab on your Facebook page.</p>
<p>Take advantage of your other social platforms as well. If you are on Twitter, intersperse your regular tweets with your blog launch news. If you are active on Pinterest and Instagram, add visuals to promote the new blog. Get it out as much and as often as you can.</p>
<h2>Leverage your current marketing activities</h2>
<p>Are you sending out postcards? Do you <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/use-newsletters-get-message/" target="_blank">send a newsletter</a> out to clients via mail or electronically? Are you running ads elsewhere, in print and online?</p>
<p>Find creative ways to include the announcement of your blog. If you have a current physical or digital mailing list, include interesting information about your new blog. If you offer an incentive for people to sign up, make that section prominent.</p>
<h2>Embrace your brick-and-mortar advantage</h2>
<div id="attachment_15649" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/brick-mortar-blog.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-15649" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/brick-mortar-blog.jpg" alt="Brick Mortar Blog" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/brick-mortar-blog.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/brick-mortar-blog-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10575698@N02/14838491179/" target="_blank">John Salvino</a> via <a href="http://compfight.com">Compfight</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>
<p>If you have a physical store, you are ahead of the game because you have a customer base that is already coming to you. Take advantage of all the face-to-face interaction you‚Äôve had with your customers ‚Äî and the deeper relationships you‚Äôve developed.</p>
<h4>Signage</h4>
<p>If appropriate, create in-store signage about the blog. Although most people won‚Äôt take the time to write down your new blog address, it will still be a visual introduction that will stick in their heads. Have fun and be creative. Try humor, if appropriate.</p>
<h4>Business cards</h4>
<p>If you hand out a lot of business cards, get new ones printed up with your blog‚Äôs URL on them. They are much easier to put in the pocket vs. a postcard or some other full-sized printed piece.</p>
<h4>Drop an announcement in the bag</h4>
<p>Insert small postcards or flyers in your bags. Although you might question just how many people will take the time to read it, it‚Äôs worth it even if you just have a small base of loyal customers.</p>
<h4>Add something to the receipt</h4>
<p>If you are able to add information to your receipts, consider adding your new blog address. A lot of people do check their receipts and it may get them online and checking you out.</p>
<h4>Talk to your customers</h4>
<p>This is your biggest advantage. Make sure you and your employees mention the new blog to your customers. But also make sure that it fits naturally into the conversation and doesn‚Äôt come across as just another sales pitch.</p>
<h2>Building your blog readership takes time</h2>
<p>Not only does a blog take work to put together and keep current, it also takes time to get the word out. As with anything, you can‚Äôt just build it and expect people to come. Be patient and provide good content.</p>
<p>Building a successful following can take anywhere from 12 to 18 months. Share your expertise with the world and keep on sharing. And if you try some of these strategies for pre-launch, you‚Äôll be a step ahead.</p>

How to do this? Incorporate uptime, performance and security checks upfront and not as an afterthought. It can seem overwhelming to track everything for every site, and all of the time, but with a few simple tools, you can stay on top of things. This ultimately means less stress and worry for your clients.</p>
<h2>Use website monitoring to get alerts for site downtime</h2>
<p>As you know, if your clients are selling anything on their sites, whether it‚Äôs services or products, optimal uptime numbers are critical. When their site is down, even if just for a few minutes, it can damage their brand‚Äôs reputation and result in lower search engine rankings.</p>
<p>To get a good grasp of your uptime stats, sometimes you will need a plugin with a fee-based service that provides reliable reports. <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom</a>¬†is a popular service for WordPress and non-WordPress sites alike. It has been around for a long time and has several different pricing plans. They also provide a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/real-user-monitoring-by-pingdom/" target="_blank">WordPress plugin</a> for easy installation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-pingdom-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15600 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-pingdom-min.jpg" alt="Website monitoring by Pingdom" width="640" height="549" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-pingdom-min.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-pingdom-min-768x658.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Editor‚Äôs note: <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/monitor-your-clients-sites-12418" target="_blank">Uptime monitoring</a> is included with GoDaddy Pro, a free program for web professionals. Learn more about <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/pro?isc=cardigan" target="_blank">GoDaddy Pro</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you are managing a WordPress site and you are using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a>, you can access its monitoring system. Jetpack checks your site in 5-minute intervals. Do note that if you are on shared hosting or have a lot of resources on the site, Jetpack may trigger unnecessary warnings because of longer load times.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-jetpack-min.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15598 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-jetpack-min.png" alt="Website monitoring by Jetpack for WordPress" width="640" height="438" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-jetpack-min.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-jetpack-min-768x525.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>There are other free plugins that come with uptime monitoring, but you may want to test them first. Other plugins that run on paid services like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/worker/" target="_blank">ManageWP Worker</a>¬†can provide accurate reports as well.</p>
<h2>Streamline your WordPress updates</h2>
<p>If you work frequently with WordPress, you know that frequent maintenance updates are a constant across the core WordPress platform, your theme and your plugins. To keep your site healthy and secure, it‚Äôs important to keep up with them. For many, this means constantly popping into a site, and, if you manage several sites, logging into them separately. Fortunately, some hosting companies are now doing <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/pro/managed-wordpress-hosting?isc=cardigan" target="_blank">auto-updates for WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on how many client sites you are monitoring and how they were developed, you may choose to avoid auto-updates and do them yourself. The ideal option is to find a way to oversee all your plugins all at once. Jetpack lets you manage connected sites in one dashboard. You can easily deactivate or activate plugins there, but unfortunately you can only update free plugins that are accessed via WordPress.org. A step up from that is a paid service.</p>
<p>There are tons of others out there, small and big, that provide maintenance and updates for sites, such at <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/" target="_blank">WPSiteCare</a>, or give you a single dashboard to do it all like <a href="https://managewp.com/" target="_blank">ManageWP</a>. Of course, they have a monthly fee but the time you save may well be worth it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-managewp-min.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15597" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-managewp-min.png" alt="Website monitoring with ManageWP" width="640" height="385" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-managewp-min.png 1314w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-managewp-min-768x462.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2>Find broken links and 404 errors</h2>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating to a site visitor than a broken link. If you have tons of content and like to change things up frequently, it increases the chances that broken links‚Äîand the <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/design/make-google-readers-happy-fix-404-error/" target="_blank">dreaded 404 page</a>¬†‚Äî will rear their ugly heads.</p>
<p>For links that are broken within your site, consider using a plugin like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/" target="_blank">Broken Link Checker</a>¬†to occasionally run a check on broken links and either replace or remove them.</p>
<p><em>Editor‚Äôs note: Broken Link Checker is not supported by some managed WordPress hosts, including <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/blacklisted-plugins-8964" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>. You can use a desktop app alternative like <a href="https://wptavern.com/how-to-check-for-broken-links-on-your-site-using-xenu-link-sleuth" target="_blank">Xenu Link Sleuth</a>¬†or <a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank">Screaming Frog SEO Spider</a>¬†instead.</em></p>
<p>Broken links from outside sites are tougher to control because you never know if someone has an incoming link to a post, service or product that you have removed. In that case, you will want to use the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank">Google Search Console</a>. This free tool is a life saver because it allows you to easily create redirects.</p>
<h2>Secure your WordPress installations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/security/" target="_blank">Security</a> is a critical need for any WordPress site. It‚Äôs a challenge keeping up with the hackers. And there is nothing worse than discovering out of the blue that your site was blacklisted on Google or that an ominous warning is popping up whenever someone accesses your site.</p>
<p>You need to decide whether you want to monitor each of your your client sites or use a tool or an outside source to do it. There are some very good security plugins out there, like <a href="https://ithemes.com/security/" target="_blank">iThemes Security</a>, with built-in alerts that show you what is happening with your site. It‚Äôs worth considering if you have the time to set up the site and perform website monitoring it this way.</p>
<p>A word of caution: If you do offer your clients a plugin like this, you will be handing over the entire site to them and even if you educate them on the plugin, they can get freaked out about all the attempted breaches and hacks, even though they were averted.</p>
<p>In some cases it may be better to see if your hosting provides enough security or perhaps an extended security package. Another option is to leave it entirely in the hands of pros like <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/web-security/malware-removal?isc=cardigan" target="_blank">Sitelock</a>¬†or <a href="https://sucuri.net/" target="_blank">Sucuri</a>. It‚Äôll take the worry out of it for both you and your clients.</p>
<h2>View site visitors‚Äô behavior</h2>
<p>Monitoring the analytics of your clients‚Äô sites often gets bumped down on the list of priorities because it can be a confusing‚Äîand overwhelming‚Äîundertaking. Understanding analytics can make a huge difference in the success of your sites.There are numerous choices out there, but <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>¬†is a reliable, free way to keep up on what is happening with your site. It gives you a ton of information on who is visiting your site and what they are doing while they are there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-google-analytics-min.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15599 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-google-analytics-min.png" alt="Website monitoring with Google Analytics" width="640" height="305" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-google-analytics-min.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/website-monitoring-google-analytics-min-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>There are several other tools that can help you monitor what is happening on the user end. For example, <a href="http://sumome.com" target="_blank">SumoMe</a>¬†has a couple of great features. You can place <a href="https://sumome.com/app/heat-maps" target="_blank">heat maps</a> on any page of your site and see where people are clicking through the most. This allows you to test landing pages and, more specifically, allows you to test your homepage. It also has something called <a href="https://sumome.com/app/content-analytics" target="_blank">Content Analytics</a>¬†that shows you where a reader stops reading on a specific page. Of course, there are other options out there; these are just two.</p>
<h2>Use these tools to make informed decisions</h2>
<p>The more ways you have of performing website monitoring on your clients‚Äô sites, the better decisions you‚Äîand they‚Äîcan make to improve functionality, website health and usability. The tools recommended here are ones that I have used personally, but there are a lot more out there that you may want to research and explore. A healthy site is a happy site.</p>

It seems you can‚Äôt put up a new post without getting 20,000 views before lunch. You need an assistant to manage your email subscription list. You actually wish celebrities would stop constantly tweeting links to your stuff, because it keeps crashing your servers. ‚ÄúApologies for the downtime,‚Äù you tweet for the third time this week. It‚Äôs exhausting.</p>
<p>Situation Two: Your blog is but a digital tumbleweed, drifting sadly across the sands of the internet. Each time you write a post, you spend hours choosing the perfect sentence structure. You compose it carefully, thoughtfully, not unlike an orchestral opus ‚Äî surely this will go viral on Facebook ‚Äî only to click ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù and get a text from your mother 40 minutes later. She appears to be your only reader. (To be fair, she loves the post.)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs safe to say the majority of us can relate to Situation Two (hi, Mom!). But the truth is, both bloggers described above have tons to gain from a well-crafted email newsletter. Here‚Äôs why I believe every blogger should offer an email subscription.</p>
<h2>Earn subscribers and drive more traffic.</h2>
<p>Fortunately, I happen to have a friend named Chelsea who‚Äôs a.) an amazing blogger, and b.) already doing everything right when it comes to email marketing. We‚Äôll use her fashion blog <a href="http://www.truelane.co/" target="_blank">truelane</a>¬†as an example of how the right email content can be any blog‚Äôs perfect sidekick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/email-subscriptioin-truelane-home-page.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15015 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/email-subscriptioin-truelane-home-page.png" alt="Email Subscription Truelane Home Page" width="640" height="373" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/email-subscriptioin-truelane-home-page.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/email-subscriptioin-truelane-home-page-768x447.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Having already crafted a super-loyal following on Instagram, Chelsea rebranded and launched her truelane website last year. Instagram is, of course, an entirely different sphere from a full-fledged blog: It‚Äôs rooted in quick, visual-centric consumption that doesn‚Äôt focus on lengthy text content. But since our ultimate goal is to have more than just Mom reading the posts we spent so much time making, a blog-based email newsletter is largely centered around bringing traffic back to the blog posts themselves.</p>
<div class="callout"> Use a signup form on your blog to kickstart the email subscription process. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any first-timer, the first step is building a signup form (If you use GoDaddy Email Marketing, <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/signup-forms-15875" target="_blank">here‚Äôs how to do it</a>) that you can use to gather new email subscribers through your blog.</p>
<p>Chelsea‚Äôs signup form sits happily on the right sidebar of her site:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-signup-form.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15019" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-signup-form.png" alt="Truelane Signup Form" width="640" height="347" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-signup-form.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-signup-form-768x416.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>If a person‚Äôs already visiting your blog and signing up to receive emails from you, you‚Äôre off to a great start. But even the most dedicated readers need reminders ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where email marketing comes in.</p>
<blockquote><p>An email newsletter shouldn‚Äôt simply redistribute your posts via email. It should act as a ‚Äúteaser‚Äù for your posts, prompting your readers to click through and read the full thing on your blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the goal being to encourage visits to your blog, you‚Äôll want to avoid offering all your blog content through email. Instead, use an excerpt-style approach to entice your email subscribers to click through and read the rest.</p>
<p>Chelsea does a great job of this. Here‚Äôs an example of one of her blog posts called <a href="http://www.truelane.co/style/2016/3/9/central-park-sun" target="_blank">Central Park Sun</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-blog-post.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15018 size-full" title="Truelane Blog Post" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-blog-post.png" alt="Truelane Blog Post" width="640" height="407" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-blog-post.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-blog-post-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here‚Äôs that same blog post, repurposed as an email newsletter:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-email-newsletter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15014" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-email-newsletter.jpg" alt="Truelane Email Newsletter" width="640" height="1529" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-email-newsletter.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-email-newsletter-768x1834.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The key is that big, gray <strong>See the post!</strong> button at the bottom.</p>
<p>Chelsea writes a custom summary of her post at the top, features an image from it, and leaves her email subscribers with a clear call-to-action.</p>
<blockquote><p>This strategy can help you make the most of a hard reality: Even people who already love your blog are just as forgetful as any of us ‚Äî and these excerpt-style emails are an awesome way to let them know when you‚Äôve published a new post.</p></blockquote>
<p>For newer readers, too, it helps establish a routine and gets them in the habit of reading your content.</p>
<h2>Establish yourself and build trust</h2>
<p>Chances are, you‚Äôre more than a blogger: you‚Äôre also an expert in your craft. Building an email newsletter grants you the chance to further establish your expertise, offering exclusive content that might never even appear on your blog.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs an example of one of Chelsea‚Äôs weekly newsletters, which she sends out toward the end of the business week:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-weekly-newsletter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15017" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-weekly-newsletter.jpg" alt="Truelane Weekly Newsletter" width="640" height="1631" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-weekly-newsletter.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-weekly-newsletter-768x1957.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>There are a handful of great content strategies we can see in action in that email:</p>
<p><strong>Weekly recap:</strong> In a more condensed fashion, Chelsea recaps the posts that went up on her blog during the week and links her readers to them. For anyone who might have missed her individual blasts, this is a nice at-a-glance review of the content that slipped past.</p>
<p><strong>Travel feature:</strong> Though Chelsea got her start in fashion, a newly growing component of truelane is the <a href="http://www.truelane.co/travel/" target="_blank">Travel section</a>. In this email, she uses her newsletter as an opportunity to remind her readers that she‚Äôs writing travel posts, too ‚Äî and she links them to her favorite one from the past week.</p>
<p><strong>Personal touch:</strong> We get a personal window into Chelsea‚Äôs life as she heads to Nashville for the weekend. Plus, we get to bask in great television together.</p>
<p><strong>Social media:</strong> At the bottom, Chelsea‚Äôs ‚ÄúSocial Standouts‚Äù section aggregates her favorite truelane social media posts from the week. Now, her email subscribers get the chance to check her out on Instagram and other social platforms, and the outreach is full-circle.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can see that email newsletters don‚Äôt just blindly redistribute your content to your subscribers‚Ä¶ they make you look legit. Because you are; you‚Äôre an expert and you love writing blog posts about it! (Ask Mom‚Ä¶ she gets it.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Another beautiful quality of email marketing is that it empowers you to stretch beyond the thematic limitations of your blog, establishing yourself as an actual person and a lover of other topics, too. Chelsea accomplishes this in her Sunday mailing, pictured below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-sunday-newsletter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15016" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-sunday-newsletter.jpg" alt="Truelane Sunday Newsletter" width="640" height="1655" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-sunday-newsletter.jpg 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/truelane-sunday-newsletter-768x1986.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>In this email, Chelsea‚Äôs simply a member of her tribe: someone who loves <em>The West Wing</em>, gets stoked about sales at Macy‚Äôs, misses Prince, and enjoys following another Minnesotan fashion blogger.</p>
<p>Complete with a restaurant recommendation, emails like this establish Chelsea as an honest-to-goodness human being who a.) has interests beyond her blog content, but b.) is also interested in many of the same things as her readers.</p>
<p>She‚Äôs earning trust because she‚Äôs not contriving an artificial way to earn trust ‚Äî she actually deserves it. By engaging with us honestly and without motive, she‚Äôs a blogger we can count on to give us the quality content we‚Äôre looking for.</p>
<h2>Use stats to build your email subscription base</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most useful behind-the-scenes aspect of an email newsletter is the data driving it. Once you start designing and sending your mailings, you‚Äôll be able to draw from your stats in order to assess your content‚Äôs performance and tailor it for future success.</p>
<p>Wondering if your readers would rather hear about fall jackets versus cool-weather hat fashion? Write an email newsletter about each topic, and see which one gets a better open rate. Write one newsletter about both topics, and see which links get clicked the most. You can even distribute a quick email survey to your readers and ask them which topic they‚Äôd rather see a blog post written for. The strategy is totally up to you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pro tip: The higher up you place a link in your content, the more people will click it. Be sparing with your links, too ‚Äî the fewer links you offer in a mailing, the more important they look to your readers.</p></blockquote>
<p>With email marketing, you can really get as granular with your statistical analysis as you want to.</p>
<ul>
<li>See who‚Äôs reading your emails the most and clicking your links all the time, and reach out to them with a cool discount code.</li>
<li>Look at your engagement stats to see how link placement and visual style affects click-through rates.</li>
<li>You can even organize your email contacts based on the links they interact with in your newsletter content, then follow up with totally custom content you‚Äôve made just for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples barely scratch the surface regarding the ways in which email statistics empower you to more deeply engage with your readers. Ultimately, you‚Äôll be able to use email marketing stats to hone in on not only what types of blog posts are inherently the most interesting to your readers, but what types of email newsletters are the most beneficial to your long-term digital content strategy.</p>
<p>This is precious information that a blog alone can‚Äôt give you.</p>
<h2>Strategically, it‚Äôs a no-brainer.</h2>
<p>I truly and emphatically believe that an email newsletter should be a central part of any blogger‚Äôs content plan.</p>
<p>Regular emails and summarized recaps remind your readers to look at your blog posts, erasing the quiet hope that they‚Äôll do so on their own. Beyond that, newsletters give you the chance to offer exclusive off-blog content that isn‚Äôt consumable anywhere else. You‚Äôll nurture a more meaningful, transparent relationship with your readers by offering a window into who you are as a person and embodying the same passions that led you to blogging in the first place. And finally, you‚Äôll draw from your email marketing statistics to further tailor content that‚Äôs precisely designed with your readers‚Äô interests in mind.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll shut your laptop, recline with your beverage of choice, and chuckle softly ‚Ä¶ for you are victorious.</p>
<p>And when that happens, you send your mom a gift basket. Because she‚Äôs been there since day one.</p>

It‚Äôs become a central part of my daily life as a WordPress programmer. And it‚Äôs not just useful for managing core, there‚Äôs a growing list of <a href="http://wp-cli.org/docs/tools/" target="_blank">plugins</a> that have WP-CLI commands baked-in, too.</p>
<p>In this article, we won‚Äôt be talking about what WP-CLI is or how to use it ‚Äî we‚Äôve previously covered <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/how-to-use-wp-cli/" target="_blank">how to use WP-CLI</a>. Instead, we will look at how to <em>create custom WP-CLI commands</em> inside our plugins. That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs time to get our hands dirty and build something awesome!</p>
<h2>Loading our command</h2>
<p>The developer API for adding custom commands depends on WP-CLI being loaded, so we‚Äôll want to make sure it‚Äôs running when we attempt to register our custom command.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we are in CLI mode then there are likely many additional files in the plugin that don‚Äôt need to be loaded at all (such as admin screens).</p>
<p>When I build a plugin, I often put all of the code for my custom command inside its own file. Then in my main plugin file, I identify the point where everything that my CLI command requires has been loaded, then require my custom command file only when WP-CLI is running and return early to avoid loading anything else.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Custom-Command-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15403" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Custom-Command-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI Custom Command Example" width="640" height="414" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Custom-Command-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Custom-Command-Example-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are always loading the API and Settings classes (presumably our CLI command must need these too).</li>
<li>We are only loading our custom command when the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI</span> constant is defined, which is a handy way to know we are running WordPress in CLI mode.</li>
<li>We are returning early in the construct, which stops execution and prevents the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">class-admin.php</span>¬†file from loading. We are in CLI mode after all, so there‚Äôs no need to load anything related to the admin area.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Registering our command</h2>
<p>Now that we have properly loaded our command, let‚Äôs open up <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">class-cli.php</span>¬†and start working with the WP-CLI developer API to register our command.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs as easy as creating a class, and using <a href="http://wp-cli.org/docs/internal-api/wp-cli-add-command/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI::add_command()</span></a> to register it.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15412 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Example.png" alt="Register Command Example" width="640" height="377" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Example-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are registering a custom command called <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">my-plugin</span>¬†using <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI::add_command</span>¬†on the last line.</li>
<li>The custom command points to the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">My_Plugin_Command</span>¬†class.</li>
<li>Since <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">greet()</span>¬†is a public method, a sub-command called <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">greet</span>¬†is automatically registered.</li>
<li>Since <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">get_year()</span>¬†is a private method, we can only call it inside our class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, let‚Äôs try it out in the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Terminal.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15413" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Terminal.png" alt="WP-CLI Register Command Terminal" width="640" height="60" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Terminal.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Register-Command-Terminal-768x72.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>We just wrote a custom command. Pretty cool!</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> It‚Äôs important to register a command that is <em>unique</em> to your plugin or project. Think of it as the namespace that all of your sub-commands will live under.</p>
<h2>Understanding args</h2>
<p>WP-CLI command methods accept two types of arguments: <strong>positional</strong> and <strong>associative</strong>.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs go a little deeper with our <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">greet</span>¬†sub-command, and allow the user to control who the greeting is for using <strong>positional</strong> arguments.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15410 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI Positional Arg Example" width="640" height="172" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Example-768x206.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Positional arguments are passed in the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$args</span>¬†array.</li>
<li>Each argument can be accessed using its numeric index, starting with zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, let‚Äôs try it out in the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Terminal.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15411 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Terminal.png" alt="WP-CLI Positional Arg Terminal" width="640" height="60" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Terminal.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Positional-Arg-Terminal-768x72.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say we want displaying the year to be optional. After all, most people already know what year it is. We can easily do this using an <strong>associative</strong> argument.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15401 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI Associative Arg Example" width="640" height="215" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Example-768x258.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Associative arguments are passed in the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$args_assoc</span>¬†array.</li>
<li>Each argument can be accessed via its associative index (e.g. <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">show-year</span>).</li>
<li>If we see <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">show-year</span>¬†in the index, we will display the year after the greeting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, let‚Äôs try it out in the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Terminal.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15402" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Terminal.png" alt="WP-CLI Associative Arg Terminal" width="640" height="117" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Terminal.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Associative-Arg-Terminal-768x140.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Great. Everything works. But there is something about our code that is kind of messy. Can you tell? That <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">isset()</span>¬†check just seems like it could be cleaner. Luckily, in WP-CLI there is a way to easily clean things up!</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://wp-cli.org/docs/internal-api/wp-cli-utils-get-flag-value/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI\Utils\get_flag_value()</span></a></p>
<h4><strong>Example</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Get-Flag-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15406 size-full" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Get-Flag-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI Get Flag Example" width="640" height="304" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Get-Flag-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Get-Flag-Example-768x364.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">get_flag_value()¬†</span>method helps us easily grab a value from the associative index.</li>
<li>In the example above, we don‚Äôt need the value, we only need to check if it exists.</li>
<li>If the index does not exist, the default value will be <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">null</span>.</li>
<li>We can optionally pass a third parameter to set the default to be anything we want.</li>
<li>This is a clean and handy alternative to doing <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">isset()</span>¬†checks everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> By using <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">get_flag_value()</span>¬†we also have automatic support for <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;no-show-year</span>. This is a feature built-in to WP-CLI that allows a boolean option flag to be negated.</p>
<h2>Using PHPDoc</h2>
<p>Now the real magic begins. You might think that <a href="https://www.phpdoc.org/" target="_blank">PHPDoc</a>¬†blocks are nothing more than a developer best-practice. Well in WP-CLI, they aren‚Äôt just a nice-to-have description of our methods, they are actually a functional part of our command!</p>
<p>Let me explain‚Ä¶</p>
<p>In our examples above, you may have noticed we did a big ‚Äúno-no‚Äù in PHP. We didn‚Äôt use <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">isset()</span>¬†to check if the numeric indexes existed before trying to reference them. We are printing <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$args[0]</span>¬†and <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$args[1]</span> without any checks whatsoever. What were we thinking?! We all know what this will lead to: Undefined Index notices. Super. Annoying.</p>
<p>Well, this is where PHPDoc in WP-CLI actually saves the day (and a bunch of lines of code).</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15408" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI PHPDoc Example" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Example-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>By using WP-CLI‚Äôs magic PHPDoc syntax, we can make sure certain arguments are required.</li>
<li>The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">first-name</span>¬†and <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">last-name</span>¬†arguments will always be required.</li>
<li>The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;show-year</span>¬†associative argument flag will be optional.</li>
<li>If our users are having trouble remembering how to use the command, they can simply use the global <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;help</span>¬†flag to display this PHPDoc in their terminal!</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, let‚Äôs try it out in the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Terminal.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15409" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Terminal.png" alt="WP-CLI PHPDoc Terminal" width="640" height="114" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Terminal.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-PHPDoc-Terminal-768x136.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2>Output: Strings</h2>
<p>The truth is, the usefulness of our custom commands relies a lot on how we output them. Thankfully, WP-CLI has once again done all of the heavy lifting for us, we just have to properly use the output methods available to us.</p>
<p>The most common type of output in commands are going to be the strings we print to the terminal.</p>
<p>The greeting message in our example above can be displayed a number of different ways using WP-CLI helper methods, each one tailored to a different context.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Output-Strings-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15407" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Output-Strings-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI Output Strings Example" width="640" height="459" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Output-Strings-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Output-Strings-Example-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2>Output: Global options</h2>
<p>When considering the output of our command, it‚Äôs also important to be familiar with the <a href="https://wp-cli.org/config/" target="_blank">global options</a>¬†that are built-in to WP-CLI.</p>
<p>As you can see in the previous string examples, some methods behave differently depending on what global options might be in use.</p>
<p>For instance, if a user runs a command using the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;quiet</span>¬†global option, all output messages will be suppressed <em>except</em> when using <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI::line()</span>. It stands to reason that this method should be used sparingly as it will <em>always</em> be printed to the terminal. We should use <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI::log()</span>¬†instead.</p>
<p>Imagine the frustration of a user trying to use the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;quiet</span>¬†flag only to see dozens of lines appear! Let‚Äôs be developers who pay attention to those kinds of UX details in our output. It‚Äôs important, even in the terminal.</p>
<h2>Formatting arrays</h2>
<p>There will be times when we want to display an array of information to our user, and give them options to display it the way they want. Never fear, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP-CLI::format_items()</span>¬†is here!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say that we have a list of different types of greetings in our plugin, and we want the user to be able to list them all the terminal.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Example.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15404" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Example.png" alt="WP-CLI Format Arrays Example" width="640" height="452" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Example.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Example-768x542.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down the example above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our greetings are stored in an array of arrays called <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$items</span>.</li>
<li>Each greeting has a <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">type</span>¬†and a <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">text</span>¬†key.</li>
<li>We are using the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">get_flag_value()</span>¬†method to get the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;format</span>¬†option value.</li>
<li>If <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;format</span>¬†is not specified, we will display a table by default.</li>
<li>We pass our <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$format</span>, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">$items</span>, and key names to the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI::format_items()</span>¬†method.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, let‚Äôs try it out in the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Terminal.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15405" src="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Terminal.png" alt="WP-CLI Format Arrays Terminal" width="640" height="413" srcset="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Terminal.png 640w, https://www.godaddy.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WP-CLI-Format-Arrays-Terminal-768x495.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>With just a few lines a code we‚Äôve given our users the ability to not only view an array of data, but easily format it the way they want using a <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&#8211;format</span>¬†option.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">WP_CLI::format_items()</span>¬†method accepts <strong>table</strong>,<strong> json</strong>,<strong> csv</strong>,<strong> yaml</strong>,<strong> ids</strong>, and <strong>count</strong> as valid format types, which we can describe in the PHPDoc for this new <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">greetings</span>¬†sub-command.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are a ton of useful tools in the WP-CLI developer API. This is great news for us developers as we look to level-up our plugins, and provide our advanced users with powerful ways to use them in the terminal.</p>
<p>I would be remiss to not point you to the official WP-CLI developer resources at this point. They contain all of the technical information about helper methods, the arguments available in them, and many great examples.</p>

Here it is: at some point we all either want to give up or at least take a serious break from our blogs. Try as we may to avoid it, we simply get burnt out and just plain frustrated. A variety of situations can cause what I like to call blogger burnout ‚Äî from self-imposed isolation with your laptop and a caffeine IV drip to simple boredom with your chosen subject matter ‚Äî but you can get through it.</p>
<p>Read on to learn more. And if you&#8217;ve already passed what might feel like the point of no return, hopefully these ideas to will help you fall back in love with your blog.</p>

<h2>You&#8217;re over-posting or spending too much time on each post.</h2>
<p>I get it, it takes a lot of work to create a single post.¬†And if you&#8217;re on your own in running your blog, the pressure mounts with every moment you devote to the next write-up. If this sounds like you, perhaps you should cut back on how long your posts are, post less frequently, or stop trying so hard to make each post perfect.</p>
<div class="callout"> Give yourself a break. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, do you really need a 2,000-word post three times a week? Or could you get away with doing shorter posts on most days? Maybe you could post once or twice a week instead of daily.</p>
<p>You also don&#8217;t need to edit the post five and six times only to scrap it completely and re-write it. Yes, you want quality content, but being too much of a perfectionist is incredibly exhausting.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;re alone in everything.</h2>
<p>Yep, it‚Äôs all you. You take the photos and do the writing. You edit your own work. You prep it for publication. Then, after it goes live, you promote the heck out of it on your <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/market/using-social-media-to-make-your-blog-more-profitable/" target="_blank">social media channels</a>.</p>
<p>And you‚Äôre tired. So tired.</p>
<p>Is it time to start outsourcing some elements of your blog production? Have you considered bringing on an editor or at least using some <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/launch/lets-bust-some-myths-about-using-stock-photos/" target="_blank">stock photos</a>¬†in lieu of taking every shot yourself?</p>
<blockquote><p>Delegating tasks could be the simple fix that will give you more time to focus on what you love about blogging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can&#8217;t afford a full-time or even a part-time helper? No problem! You can <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/manage/hiring-contractor-writing-job-description/" target="_blank">hire folks</a>¬†for a project or two at a time and then, once you&#8217;re making more money, you can bring on more help.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this in my own blogging business and it&#8217;s certainly helping big time. I no longer stress over taking all my own images; I buy stock images. I don&#8217;t handle all my own social media anymore, and if I do it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/wordpress/social-media-management-tools-for-bloggers/" target="_blank">scheduled ahead of time</a>¬†when I have downtime to work on it. I have even brought helpers on board when the workload is high and I just need someone to find me some links related to my topic for research purposes.</p>
<p>Sometimes that little bit of help is all you need to feel better about things.</p>
<h2>All you do is blog.</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, if you were in a traditional 9-to-5 you would go home each day and recharge your batteries. When you run a blog, however, it seems like there is always work to be done.</p>
<div class="callout"> Too many bloggers keep working long after they should have stopped for the day. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much of anything can get monotonous, and that can affect your writing as well as your mindset. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/smallbusiness/manage/improve-your-health-increase-your-income-and-avoid-burnout/" target="_blank">Take the break</a>, go for a walk, smell the fresh air, go to bed earlier ‚Äî do whatever it takes to replenish your creative juices.</p>
<p>I personally went through a rough period in 2015 when I literally could not write anything for nearly a month. Luckily, I had batched a lot of stuff and didn&#8217;t have any terrible pressing deadlines at that time ‚Äî but I would have been in big trouble if I had to write while my creative well was dry.</p>
<blockquote><p>I couldn&#8217;t string two sentences together, let alone write 900 to 2,000 words on any subject. Do you want to know what happened after I essentially took that month off? My productivity skyrocketed! In less than a week I got more done than I had in the previous eight weeks‚Äô time.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you feel like you&#8217;re overdoing it, you probably are.</p>
<p>Taking a break isn&#8217;t selfish ‚Äî it&#8217;s allowing your mind, body and spirit time to recharge. And that makes it much easier to fall back in love with blogging.</p>
<h2>You‚Äôre over your subject matter.</h2>
<p>This is normal. You‚Äôve been blogging about the same topic over and over and over again and you are literally triple over it. Now it is time to make some hard decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Can guest posters handle the heavy lifting while you figure out if your heart is still in it?</strong> You‚Äôll still get fresh content for your blog without having to do all the hard work. You can use that downtime to analyze your true feelings. Who knows? Those guest bloggers might tackle your topic in fresh ways that re-ignite your passion for it.</p>
<p><strong>Can you pivot to a new angle, and therefore a revived sense of excitement?</strong> Many writers attribute their blogger burnout to the fact they‚Äôve just written way too much about the same subject. If you can&#8217;t find a new angle, can you at least expand and go for a broader niche?</p>
<p>For example, if your blog focuses on exercise, maybe you can pivot into wellness in general. You might write some posts about nutrition or meditating. You don‚Äôt need to go completely off-topic to breathe new life into your blog (and your passion for it).</p>
<p><strong>Should you simply stop posting so much or take a break to see if the fire is still there after some time away?</strong> After a week or two you might find that you have a completely new insight for your topic.</p>
<p><strong>Or is it time to break up with your blog and start a new one that you&#8217;re passionate about?</strong> You might even be able to sell your blog if it has a decent amount of income and page views.</p>
<h2>Blogger burnout is real</h2>
<p>Just remember, feeling angst towards your blog once every now and then is completely normal.</p>
<p>However, if the feeling persists, you might be suffering from blogger burnout. There&#8217;s no shame in throwing in the towel, of course, but I hope you‚Äôll try the tips in this post before you do ‚Äî if you‚Äôve poured your heart and soul into your blog, isn‚Äôt it worth trying to rekindle that passion? Methinks so.</p>
